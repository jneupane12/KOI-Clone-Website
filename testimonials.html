            <p><span>Bilal Mukhtar, Pakistan</span> Master of Professional Accounting</p>
            <p>…If someone tells you that there is an academic institution offering highly demanding study programs and it lies in the heart of Sydney, well-experienced teachers from Brazil, Philippines, Pakistan, Australia and many more, tidy and well-organized study spaces, an array of reference books in the library and great people to help out at administration, what would be your answer? Definitely “yes” and it was mine too.
In addition, I learned how to do proper in-text citations in quantitative and qualitative research and leading a group of team-mates from Zimbabwe, Kenya, Nepal, India and other countries doing my final research project.
KOI taught me how to manage your teammates, study-work life, frequent interstate visits, family-friends and many other things to let stable and flourish in my life.</p>

            <p>…After doing a lot of research, I found KOI the best option because it had a degree that I wanted to do within my budget range. I chose KOI because I wanted a well-rounded education, small class sizes where I got the chance to build a close relationship with other students and my teachers. I found the KOI environment to be exceptionally well. All the academic and non-academic staff of KOI are ready to help students at any time. Besides lecture classes, KOI provides tutorial classes where students get practical knowledge of the real world.
It offers different opportunities such as swimming lessons, PTE information sessions, FUTSAL
competitions, and internship scholarships to students who qualify through their academic performance.
I was awarded an Internship scholarship by KOI as I reached a GPA above 3.5.
KOI has a diverse and multicultural environment where cultural events are celebrated with love and respect. I am in the final trimester of my undergraduate course and I would like to thank all the academic and non-academic staff who have supported me throughout my entire journey at KOI.</p>

            <p>… I find it to be a very caring and friendly environment at King’s Own Institute where the staff in the institution from faculty to tutors are exceptionally helpful. KOI has not only helped me with academic excellence but also has contributed to my personality development. The best thing about being the student here is the opportunity to participate in additional opportunities like extra classes for tips on excelling on PTE/IELTS, internship classes, swimming lessons, various cultural events and more. I am in my final year of undergraduate course and ready to utilise the knowledge and experience I have gained from KOI in the real world. I have been able to manage my shift work and study as KOI is very flexible with different timetables according to our needs. I would heartily like to welcome all new and former students to utilise the best services provided by
…An investment in knowledge pays the best interest” that is why I have decided to invest in myself and started to study accounting at King’s Own Institute in Sydney, Australia.
By studying in Sydney I have got a knowledge, skills and experience from diverse cultures, which I would not be able to get back in Europe.
Without any hesitation it is was my best investment I have ever made in my life…</p>

            <p>…As a university graduate major in Financial Engineer, In 2013 I left Medellin, Colombia to make my biggest dream come true, “Coming to Australia and building my life” and since, facing new challenges such as living in overseas I have developed skills to make myself to move forward.
I do believe I am closer to the dream one step per day while studying a postgraduate program at King’s Own Institute with well-qualified lecturers who are my mentors…</p>
